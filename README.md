# High-Level Project Summary
Sun Runner is a game in which children and teenagers learn about cosmic phenomena in general, as well as the history of the Parker Solar Probe, by solving various puzzles. They will be able to find out exactly what record this probe broke and why it was so important to launch it. We also hope that the fact that our game has many text parts that are interrupted by gameplay will help children to love reading. This is a very important topic, encouraging children to learn science and reading, with the help of interesting tasks and pictures.

# Detailed Project Description
<img width="1077" height="605" alt="unnamed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48cfd899-9c49-4f5d-b8e5-267dc709fcd2" />
<br><br>
Sun runner is a game about a group of scientists watching the Parker Solar Probe on its way to the corona of the sun. Overcoming difficulties, the probe moves closer and closer to the hottest point of the star's surface. You are an intern about to learn about the technology that made the Parker Solar Probe possible, and how it deals with space threats.
<br><br>
Since the story is aimed at a young audience, the scientific component and the story itself are diluted with game modules that allow the player to relax and strengthen previously acquired knowledge.
<br><br>
So, one step away from the sun, the probe suddenly deviates from the course due to the solar wind. Colleagues ask you to deal with this situation, but for this, you will need to access the video instruction, which is located on the cloud server. Access to it can only be obtained with the help of a decoder hidden somewhere in the warehouse.

## Locations
The main mechanic of the game is a quest-like movement. You can navigate through a specific list of locations by pointing to where you want to go with the mouse. Some locations contain items that make up the quest itself.
<br><br>

## Quests
The quest system combines the mechanics of hidden objects and quest games. This helps to develop mindfulness and logic, forcing the user to solve complex problems. To solve the first quest, the player must go to the server room and find the key card there. In the warehouse, you can use it to open the storage door and pick up the decoder from there. By applying the decoder to the computer, the player gets the opportunity to set up the decryption.
<br><br>

## Arcade
Of course, the game will not force a teenager to engage in real data decryption. Instead, he will be offered to play through the arcade game in order to keep the player interested. This game is made in a simple and understandable flow. The goal is to bring the ship to the finish line while avoiding moving obstacles. 
<br><br>
<img width="1077" height="613" alt="unnamed-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd500091-c8bf-4fe6-91e0-dda82bc47410" />
<br><br>
To successfully complete the game, you need to go through three levels, each more difficult than the previous one. Upon completion of the game, the player will be presented with instructions to help resolve the Parker Solar Probe issue.
<br><br>
<img width="1073" height="607" alt="unnamed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93a8deca-9178-4509-a624-cbf5076f9c83" />

## Visual Novel
For the most understandable way of presenting scientific information, the visual novel was chosen as the narrative format. This allows you to dilute dry text with pictures and videos, the user feels interactivity, and can also use a glossary containing definitions of complex scientific terms. This approach allows you to keep the player interested and not frighten him off with a "ton of text". 
<br><br>
<img width="1030" height="570" alt="unnamed-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9511664-6079-46ed-98a3-63675691e153" />
<br><br>
After the end of the guide, which tells about the interaction of the Parker Solar Probe with the solar wind, the sun, and Venus, the next part of the game begins. It turns out that the momentary loss of navigation is not a real threat to the probe and, probably, more experienced scientists decided to play a trick on the newcomer. The instruction closes and the player returns to the control room.

## Chipset
After some time, for some unknown reason, the power supply of the station fails. Observation of the probe becomes impossible. In this regard, the intern is given the task of dealing with the generator and returning power. Entering the generator room, the player discovers that one of the chips is out of order and tries to replace it. Chipset is a complex quest that consists of two parts. First, the player needs to find several chip components at the station, and then, going to the generator panel, correctly arrange the components on the board. 
<br><br>
<img width="1081" height="608" alt="unnamed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c47dfb0e-8399-4c41-8483-a9bfe263c666" />
<br><br>
After that, the quest is considered completed and power can be applied, but this requires the correct setting of the levers on the generator panel.

## Puzzle
The puzzle starts after the Chipset quest. It is a replacement for the actual generator work. It allows the player to learn some interesting facts about the Parker Solar Probe in the form of a game. 
<br><br>
<img width="1074" height="605" alt="unnamed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f4c3ee5-a031-4355-a8c7-1f27852dc8fb" />
<br><br>
After assembling the image of the probe, the player is given the opportunity to learn more about its individual parts by clicking on them. The player receives information about what it is and why it is needed.
<br><br>
<img width="1072" height="606" alt="unnamed-1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29615c93-54c6-4dcd-95ca-dd50e1d35742" />
<br><br>
At this point, the game moves on to the final part, consisting of conclusions, concisely submitted information, studied by the player earlier, and some facts about the future of the Parker Solar Probe.

# Space Agency Data
We used NASA-offered data. It was both general information about cosmic bodies and phenomena, and direct information about the journey of the Parker Solar Probe. All the data displayed by NASA on their official website gave us the opportunity to understand well all the necessary details and convey them in simple language, understandable and interesting for the younger generation.
<br><br>
All the data we used were presented in the form of some small in-game information inserts. The main thing we tried to achieve by providing information in the game is that the young player does not get bored reading a lot of information. Therefore, these information moments always intersect with game mechanics in one way or another.
<br><br>
For example, we took data about the probe itself exclusively on the NASA website, both about its history in general and details of its structure.

# Hackathon Journey

These two days of participation in the Space Apps Challenge were not the easiest, but at the same time very interesting. We had to quickly learn to work in a team and share responsibilities. Some issues had to be resolved in a dispute, but we always came to the same decision and continued to work diligently. Despite these minor problems, it was very interesting, exciting, and most importantly, very informative. Due to the fact that most of the team did not know much about the space topic, we all had to learn a lot of new things.
<br><br>
The main thing that inspired us was the opportunity to take part in the education of children and teenagers.
